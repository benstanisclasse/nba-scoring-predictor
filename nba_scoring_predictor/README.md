## 🔧 Configuration

Edit `config/settings.py` to customize:

```python
# Training settings
DEFAULT_SEASONS = ['2022-23', '2023-24', '2024-25']
MIN_GAMES_PLAYED = 10
OPTIMIZATION_TRIALS = 50

# Feature engineering
ROLLING_WINDOWS = [3, 5, 10, 15, 20]
EWM_ALPHAS = [0.1, 0.3, 0.5]

# Model configurations
MODEL_CONFIGS = {
    'xgboost': {
        'n_estimators': [100, 200, 300, 500],
        'max_depth': [3, 6, 9, 12],
        # ... more parameters
    }

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Import Errors**
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **NBA API Rate Limits**
   - Wait a few minutes between large data requests
   - Use cached data when available

3. **GUI Issues on Linux**
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install python3-pyqt5
   ```

4. **Memory Issues with Large Datasets**
   - Reduce the number of players in training
   - Use `use_cache=True` to avoid re-downloading data

### Testing the System
```bash
python test_system.py
```
